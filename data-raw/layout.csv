'3,'Text 5,"'Over the past twenty years, economic theorists have become increasingly aware of the fact that many economic problems can be usefully analyzed by explicitly considering the nature of actors' limited information and the role that economic institutions play in shaping outcomes through affecting actors' incentives and strategic behavior. Information economics and game theory have had a major impact on economists' view of almost all branches of economics. As part of this over-all ferment of ideas and research, theorists have devoted considerable attention to analyzing incentive contracting problems that arise in the study of public procurement, private procurement, regulation, the theory of the firm, the theory of organizations, and managerial compensation. Many of the same abstract themes and ideas arise in all of these areas and, in fact, many of these abstract topics and themes have become distinct subjects of study themselves. Even the number of theory papers analyzing defense procurement per se is quite large. However, the entire literature analyzing models relevant to defense procurement is many times larger. The purpose of this chapter is to provide an introduction to the incentive models literature that is relevant to defense procurement. Government undeniably faces an incredibly complex and multi-faceted incentive problem in military procurement. Defense firms have private information and not all their actions can be monitored. Huge uncertainties pervade the process and complete long-term contracts are generally impossible to write and difficult to enforce. Much of the procurement process occurs in a situation of bi-lateral monopoly and both sides of the market are wary of making specific investments that will reduce their bargaining power. R&D is a key output of the process and the inherent difficulty of objectively measuring the quality of new ideas adds immeasurably to the incentive problem. Finally, on top of everything else, ""government"" in reality is not a single rational actor, but is itself a complex hierarchical institution, and incentive problems between actors within government are important in themselves and also impact the way that government is able to interact with defense firms.",'17,'26.24511719

Less technical discussions of incentive models and their role in explaining defense procurement are contained in Baron (1993), Rogerson (1994) and Sandler and Hartley (1995).

External uncertainty is uncertainty in the demand for a weapon due to changes in the external threat, changes in the availability of substitute weapons, or simply changes in Congress's willingness to purchase certain weapons. As events of the early 1990s make abundantly clear, external uncertainties are also enormous for most weapons systems.",'34,'98.48632813
'5,'Text 18,"'A major consequence of these large uncertainties is that the Department of Defense (DoD) typically does not find it feasible or desirable to sign long-term fixed-price production contracts. In the design phase, the ultimate nature of the final weapon is not yet known. Even after production begins, the weapon will continue to evolve in unanticipated ways and DoD's demand will change in unanticipated ways. Thus long- term fixed-price contracts for the entire decade or more long production run typical of most weapons systems are thought to be infeasibleÂ² DoD's failed attempt to use such contracts in the 1960s (which was referred to as the total package procurement approach) is generally thought to have conclusively demonstrated the infeasibility of this approach [Burnett and Scherer (1990, pp. 304-305)]. Rather, production contracts are signed for one annual lot of production at a time on an annual basis.",'35,'97.41210938
'5,'Text 19,"'In fact, these same uncertainties typically mean that even fixed-price annual contracts are difficult to fully enforce. Unanticipated changes almost always occur and these result in substantial renegotiations during the life of the contract.",'36,'80.76171875

'5,'Text 20,"'Within most sectors of the defense industry, there are multiple firms that would be capable ex-ante of designing and producing a given weapons system. Therefore economies of scale do not appear to preclude the existence of multiple competitors at the beginning of a program. Furthermore, design expenditures are relatively small in the early phases of a program, and, given uncertainties at the design stage, it is often sensible to pursue multiple design strategies since it is not clear which will work best. The result is that DoD very typically funds two design approaches through to the stage where prototypes are built. Thus, economies of scale do not preclude the existence of competition through to the end of the design phase.",'38,'96.67968750
'5,'Text 21,"'However, production is another matter. Given the relatively small quantities purchased of most weapons systems, it is generally thought to be completely uneconomic to have multiple firms produce the same weapon system. Furthermore, the same reasoning implies that it is uneconomic to have two or three designs enter",'39,'92.48046875
'5,'Text 22,"'2 Note that the possibility of unanticipated price inflation is not generally a major problem. This can be, and is, dealt with fairly well through using inflation adjustment formulas based on price indices for various industrial products.

Dramatic cost reductions could generally be achieved by purchasing larger quantities of only one design. Therefore, it is generally the case that production of almost all major weapons systems occurs in a sole source environment. Although the existence of mild substitutes may create some competitive pressures in some cases, there will not typically be a close substitute for any major system and thus the effect of competition between substitutes is limited.",'43,'97.90039063
'6,'Text 24,"'The major implication of this is that prices cannot be competitively determined. As explained above, at the end of the design phase when there is still competition, pervasive uncertainties prevent the signing of a single production contract for the entire production run. Thus the bulk of all production contracts will be negotiated with a sole source.",'44,'96.14257813
'6,'Text 25,"'Government's response to this has been to base prices on estimated costs. A fixed price is typically negotiated for each annual production lot. However, the fixed price is determined largely by historic and projected accounting costs, both of which are carefully and meticulously audited. A ""profit"" term is also added to compensate firms for the cost of capital and risk-bearing [Rogerson (1992c)]. Thus, during the production phase, the sole source producer operates much as does a regulated utility with a fairly similar type of incentive for cost efficiency. If it manages to find a new way to lower its costs, it will keep the benefit for the current production but government will eventually receive the benefit when new prices for future production are negotiated.",'45,'95.94726563
'6,'Text 26,"'Even the extent to which annual fixed-price contracts are truly fixed price is open to question. Under the Truth in Negotiations Act (TINA), defense contractors must submit detailed ""current accurate and complete"" cost estimates when they negotiate the price of a contract with DoD. Firms that achieve large unpredicted cost reductions therefore expose themselves to a significant risk of prosecution for failing to reveal all they knew at the time of the negotiation. In this way, TINA converts a fixed-price contract into something more closely resembling a cost-reimbursement contract [Kovacic (1991, Section 3.2)].",'46,'95.84960938

The main consequence of this is that it creates a major hold-up problem [Williamson (1985)].

Firms may worry that expenditures to create better design teams will never be recovered since there is no good alternative use for this asset.",'52,'97.55859375
'7,'Text 30,"'Government has responded to firms' fears to invest in specific assets in three ways. First, it has become a purchaser of the intermediate product ""R&D"", as well as the final product, ""functioning weapons systems"". That is, government directly funds a large portion of defense-related R&D. In most purely commercial markets, consumers of course do not purchase R&D. Rather they only purchase final products if they value the results of the R&D as embodied in the product. One reason for this is that the direct purchase of R&D is complicated by difficult incentive problems. Thus, by responding to the hold-up problem and directly funding R&D, government has created a new incentive problem for itself. How can it induce defense firms to perform good R&D?",'53,'97.31445313
'7,'Text 31,"'Second, it has become the purchaser of many specific physical assets for defense firms. Physical assets that cannot be easily adapted to other weapons programs are termed ""special tools and test equipment"" and these are purchased directly by government. Although statistics are very difficult to come by, I am told by informed industry and government sources that the dollar value of such government funded capital is often very large and is comparable to the dollar value of firm funded capital. As well, the government sometimes provides contractual guarantees that capital will be paid for if a program is canceled (e.g., the B1 and B2) or literally builds and owns the entire physical plant (e.g., the F16). However, these latter practices are more rare.",'54,'93.75000000
'7,'Text 32,"'Third, through a massive set of regulations and policies, DoD has established an extra-contractual administrative relationship with firms that provides them with a range of guarantees that their specific investments will not be appropriated [Crocker and Reynolds (1993), Goldberg (1976)]. Perhaps the major such regulatory guarantee is the regulatory directive that prices will be cost-based when negotiations occur with a sole source. That is, procurement regulations specifically instruct contracting officers negotiating with a sole source that their job is not to obtain the lowest price. Rather, regulations instruct them in great detail how to calculate a fair price based on estimated costs and instruct them to obtain this price. The fair price also includes a ""profit"" term which is meant to reimburse firms for the cost of capital, the cost of risk-bearing and other economic costs not recognized as costs by the accounting system [Rogerson (1992c)]. Many of the cost elements that the regulations instruct contracting officers to pay for are likely to be sunk at the time of negotiation.",'55,'95.01953125
'7,'Text 33,"'There is a distinct element of reputational enforcement inherent in this relationship. Some of the DoD behavior that provides investment guarantees is simply DoD practice and not mandated by any regulation. Even behavior mandated by regulations cannot be completely relied on because regulations can be changed. Of course, it can be difficult to change regulations, especially when defense firms can directly lobby Congress to intervene, etc. This difficulty in changing regulations works to DoD's advantage in convincing firms that they can rely on the regulations. Nonetheless, there is also an",'56,'91.35742188

Namely, DoD would often benefit in the short run from reneging on all of its commitments and negotiating the lowest possible prices for the current period's prices. However, in the long run, DoD would be harmed because it would no longer be able to convince firms to engage in specific investments. Thus, it may well be rational for DoD to honor its implicit commitments as codified in its regulations.",'59,'98.92578125
'8,'Section header 8,"'2,6. The program life cycle",'60,'89.25781250
'8,'Text 35,"'Based on the above discussion, we can view the life cycle of a program as being divided into three phases. First is the design phase, during which multiple firms pursue competing designs. In early portions of the design phase there may be five or more firms; however, by the end of this phase, DoD is usually left with two competing firms, each with its own design. DoD directly funds most of this research through cost- reimbursement contracts. However, competition for the production franchise is often intense and thus firms often augment DoD funding with their own private funds.",'61,'96.48437500
'8,'Text 36,"'The second phase is the sole source selection phase, in which firms submit prototypes, final design plans, etc. to DoD SO it can evaluate the relative merits of the designs. They also typically bid on the next increment of work, which consists of finalizing the design, establishing the production line, and producing the first few items. DoD selects a winner based on its evaluation of the competing designs (their likely performance, production cost, maintainability, etc.) and the bids on the next increment of work. A single winner is chosen because of economies of scale.",'62,'93.31054688
'8,'Text 37,"'The third phase is the production phase, during which the winner of the source selection phase produces the product. This phase may last a decade or more. An important point is that almost all of the production contracts are signed in a sole source environment after the winner has been chosen, because of cost uncertainties, demand uncertainties, and the evolving nature of the product. Prices in the production phase are highly cost based. Although production occurs under a series of annually signed fixed-price contracts, each contract's price is largely determined by audited historic and audited projected accounting costs. Furthermore, strict application of TINA probably even makes each annual fixed-price contract more cost-based than a true fixed-price contract.",'63,'96.58203125

'8,'Text 38,"'An interesting perspective on the role of the above four characteristics in generating the regulatory problem of defense procurement can be obtained by considering how the regulatory problem would change if only some were true. In particular, it is illuminating to consider the first two features as one group (R&D is important; large uncertainties) and the second two as a separate group (large economies of scale in production imply the absence of close substitutes; government is sole purchaser).",'65,'96.09375000

The obvious example of such an industry is the computer industry. Computer procurement works in a completely different fashion than weapons procurement [Kelman (1990)]. The government does not directly buy R&D; rather, it buys final products much as occurs in any normal commercial market. Furthermore, it does not directly fund facilities capital investments. Finally, procurement is usually accomplished through competitive bidding with no element of cost based pricing.",'69,'97.70507813
'9,'Text 41,"'Now suppose that only the second group of features was true. This would be an industry where technological advance is not particularly important and thus efficient production is the only real issue. However, there are large economies of scale SO there is room in the market for only one firm. This is, of course, the description of a traditional public utility regulation problem. Thus, in some sense, the production phase of a procurement problem can be viewed as a typical public utility problem. What makes defense procurement special, is that each franchise lasts only a decade or so, and firms compete for the franchise by performing R&D. Furthermore, generating the correct amounts of the correct types of R&D is a major goal of the regulatory system.",'70,'97.02148438

'9,'Text 42,"'One feature that distinguishes defense procurement from traditional public utility regulation is that each production program can be viewed as its own franchise and thus ex-ante competitions for each franchise are generally possible. This feature means that the regulatory problem in defense is much more closely related to incentive issues that arise in the theory of the firm than is the standard regulatory problem. In particular, DoD's long-term relational partnerships with suppliers are similar, in some respects, to the type of relationships that large commercial firms such as General Motors, have with their major suppliers. Production of major automobile subcomponents or parts often requires specific investments in R&D or physical capital. Production often occurs by a single source. However, the relationship is nested in a larger competitive environment where GM could turn to different subcontractors for future programs if it wished. Thus, just as in defense procurement, sole source relationships with specific investments occur in the context of a larger competitive environment for future programs.",'72,'95.80078125
'9,'Text 43,"'One of the major differences between the DoD problem and GM's problem regards the ""make versus buy"" decision. Many observers believe that government either lacks the ability to take production in-house (due to low civil service pay scales, cumbersome personnel systems, lack of flexibility for decision-making, etc.), or simply does not want to design and produce its own weapons because of an ideological preference for private enterprise If this is true, then the government's options to make instead",'73,'92.62695313

This difference is interesting, because, as will be discussed further in the next two sections, a major problem faced by the defense regulatory system is how to provide incentives for R&D. There is some evidence that large commercial firms deal with this problem by moving production in- house. Monteverde and Teece (1982) show that large automotive firms are much more likely to produce a component in-house if it involves large amounts of R&D. This suggests that provision of incentives for R&D may be a particularly difficult problem in purchaser/supplier relationships.",'77,'98.77929688

'10,'Text 46,"'A recurring theme in the above discussion is the necessity for providing incentives for innovation. This part will explain how the current system provides these incentives. An important characteristic of the R&D stage is that the output of this stage is inherently difficult or impossible to measure objectively and describe for purposes of contracting. That is, it is essentially impossible to sign explicit incentive contracts at the R&D stage that specify all possible good ideas and the reward that the firm will be paid as a function of which good idea it comes up with. The obvious objectively verifiable signal of whether a firm has created a successful new weapons design is whether DoD chooses to purchase it. Thus, a regulatory system could create prizes for innovation by guaranteeing that firms which generate ideas good enough to be adopted by the government will receive prizes in the form of economic profit on the production phase of the system. Furthermore, if profit was awarded approximately as a percentage of cost, this might also tend to award larger prizes to more important innovations, at least in a rough sense.",'79,'96.72851563
'10,'Text 47,"'This is, in fact, the approach that DoD appears to follow. The overall result of DoD's regulatory system is that a defense firm selected to be sole source producer of a weapons systems earns economic profit on the production phase of the program and the prospect of earning this sole source profit gives defense firms an incentive to exert their best efforts at the design phase. Two different approaches have been used to empirically estimate the size of this effect. Rogerson (1989, 1991c) uses an event study methodology to estimate the size of the prizes that winners of design contests earn and finds that it is equal to approximately 3.3% to 4.7% of revenues earned in the production phase. Lichtenberg (1988) directly estimates the effect of government business on defense firms' private R&D expenditures and finds that one dollar of production purchases may stimulate 54 cents of such expenditures.",'80,'92.23632813

Of course, these tools will have different effects on other goals, like efficiency at the production stage.

In the SPP, a principal (government) must hire an agent (the firm) to produce a single unit of a commodity with well-defined characteristics that can be objectively specified. Government is uncertain about the cost of producing the commodity. Although it cannot predict the eventual cost of production with certainty, it is able to audit and thus measure the ex-post cost of production. Government can sign a contract with a firm that makes government's payment to the firm a function of the measured ex-post cost of production. There are a fixed number of firms, n, capable of producing the commodity. This section will consider the case where n equals one and the next section will consider the case where n is greater than one. The firms may or may not have private information about their likely production costs. Government needs to hire a single firm. Government's goal is to minimize its expected costs of procurement on this procurement considered in isolation. That is, there are no considerations about the effects of this procurement on future procurements for the same or related products.

Therefore, a cost-reimbursement contract enables the principal to extract all of the joint surplus generated by the relationship, but the level of joint surplus generated is low because no effort is induced.

'29,'Text 196,"'Second, the main focus of the incentives literature has been on the role of asymmetric information at the sole source selection phase in allowing government to make credible commitments to give prizes for innovation. The issue is ""How does government credibly commit to award prizes?"" Suppose, as was done in Sections 3 and 4, that the principal has all the bargaining power at the source selection phase, in the sense that the principal can make a take-it-or-leave-it offer. If there is no asymmetric information at the source selection phase then, in the absence of any other commitments on the part of the principal, the agents know that they will earn no surplus at the source selection phase regardless of how good their design is. Working backwards, they will therefore have no incentive to perform R&D at the design phase. However, now suppose that there is asymmetric information at the source selection phase. Then agents will expect to earn positive rents at the source selection phase, and in many plausible situations agents will perceive that their expected rents are increasing in R&D effort, SO this creates an incentive for R&D. Therefore asymmetric information at the source selection phase may be desirable because it creates a credible commitment on the part of government not to expropriate all the benefits of firms' R&D. This then suggests that government might be able to influence the amount and quality of R&D that firms perform by committing to institutional procedures that affect its ability to extract rent at the source selection phase. In particular, by committing to procedures that reduce competition or reduce the amount of information that government has available at the source selection phase, it may be that firms' incentives to perform R&D would increase [see Laffont and Tirole (1988b), Piccione and Tan (1993), Riordan and Sappington (1989), Tan (1992), Tirole (1986a), and Sappington (1986) for models that explore aspects of this issue].",'283,'95.16601563
'29,'Text 197,"'The third subject investigated by formal models is the ""franchise bidding"" aspect of the problem that is created by the fact that multiple firms typically perform R&D and then a sole source is selected for production. For a moment, ignore the effects of source selection procedures and pricing procedures in the sole source phase on firms' incentives to perform R&D - this was described above. Even if firms' R&D efforts can be directly controlled by government, the fact that multiple firms bid for the sole source franchise creates some interesting questions. In particular, it is reasonable to expect that much of the profit earned at the sole source production stage will be bid away at the source selection phase. If this is true, there is no reason to necessarily insist on using regulatory institutions at the sole source production stage that extract all the rent at that stage. In particular, one could allow rents to be earned at this stage if this would create some other benefit. Two possible benefits that have",'284,'87.69531250

Bower and Osband's argument is particularly clever. They build a model where allowing higher profit rates on sole source production contracts actually reduces over-all expected contractor profits and increases government's welfare. The intuition for their result is that the differential subsidization created by profit policy at the sole source phase (higher- cost producers receive higher markups) encourages more aggressive competition at the source selection phase. This paper very strikingly illustrates the general idea that the procurement stages are interrelated and that policy instruments applied at one stage may have quite surprising and unintended consequences for behavior at other stages. Many more insights remain to be gleaned from procurement models that explicitly model procurement as occurring over three stages - design, source selection, and production - and consider the interlinkages between stages.",'287,'98.87695313

Because the design continues to evolve in difficult-to-anticipate ways, and because of uncertainty regarding future demand, long- term contracts cannot be signed. In such situations, even if the firm is initially better informed than government, we might expect much of the firm's private information to be revealed over time as costs of production for each year are observed.",'289,'95.26367188
'30,'Text 200,"'One focus of the theoretical literature has been to highlight the crucial role of commitment ability in such situations. Consider the pure self selection model with a single agent from Section 3. Now, however, assume that the procurement will occur twice and that the agent's type remains the same over both procurements. Such a model has been considered by Laffont and Tirole (1988a). Let p*(c) denote the optimal contract to offer in the one-period version. It is straightforward to show that, if the principal can make a long-term commitment, the best policy for the principal is to commit to offer p* (c) both times. However, now consider what happens if the principal cannot make a binding commitment to the period-2 contact. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that the principal initially promises to offer p*(c) both periods and the agent initially believes him. Then, in period 1, the agent will choose a cost according to his type as described in Section 3. In particular, the principal will be able to precisely infer the agent's type, since higher types choose strictly higher costs. This means that, at the start of period 2, the principal knows the agent's type. Since the principal now knows the agent's type, he will of course no longer want to offer p*(c). Realizing this at stage 1, the agent will alter his selection of C to take into account the effects of this on the principal's period-2 choice. Laffont and Tirole (1988a) solve for equilibrium behavior in this model. The general flavor of the results is that the inability to commit",'290,'95.26367188

This creates a distinct incentive for firms to find ways to lower costs. Namely, if they find a way to lower cost, they can ""keep"" the savings on the current contract.",'294,'97.07031250

But DoD's budget is the size of a small country's GNP and decision- making must necessarily be decentralized among thousands of individuals with potentially conflicting objectives. The way that government organizes its decision- making procedures, and the incentives faced by individual acting in their own self- interest, will affect how these decisions are made. Thus, government faces a massive planning, organizational, and incentive problem of its own, independent of any problems it faces with defense firms [Baron (1993), Leitzel (1993)].",'298,'96.33789063

One type of model is the normal two-level principal agent model where the principal is interpreted as Congress and the agents are interpreted to be the military services or other agencies within DoD. This type of model therefore completely abstracts away from the incentive problem between government and defense firms. One interesting conclusion that has emerged from this type of model is that the military services may derive some of their power to affect policy through strategically controlling program decisions made early in a program's life.",'307,'95.26367188
'32,'Text 211,"'A theme of the literature on government decision-making dating back to Niskanen (1971) is that a goal of government bureaucrats may be to maximize the size of their own budget. It is well-accepted that military services act as though this is one of their primary goals [Fox (1988), McNaugher (1989), Stubbing (1986)].",'308,'90.13671875
'32,'Text 212,"'In Niskanen's (1971) theory, bureaucrats are assumed to be able to maximize their budget by exercising a sort of monopoly power. He assumes that an individual government bureau is the only possible supplier of a particular product and is able to make Congress a take-it-or-leave-it offer. Rather than offer Congress the first-best quantity (where marginal cost equals marginal benefit), the bureau offers Congress the largest quantity that Congress would prefer to having nothing (where total cost equals total benefit). Faced with the offered quantity or nothing, Congress chooses the offered quantity. The bureau then receives a budget sufficient to produce this quantity.",'309,'94.62890625

The key fact which this theory is based on is that defense programs are executed over",'310,'87.93945313

However, many relatively complex and technical decisions made early in the program's life affect the marginal benefits and marginal costs that Congress will face when it makes annual quantity decisions. In many cases, these early decisions are delegated to the military services and Congress has a difficult time evaluating the technical merits or consequences of these decisions. This means the military services can strategically manipulate Congress's future decisions through their decisions made early in the program's life which affect future marginal benefits and marginal costs.",'313,'96.38671875
'33,'Text 215,"'In this theory, the source of the bureau's power to influence its budget is its informational advantage. Congress can still be viewed as ""moving first"" or as designing the over-all mechanism that is played. At the outset, Congress has two choices. If it delegates certain decisions to the military, better decisions will be made in a variety of technical dimensions because of the military's greater technical expertise. However, the military may also purposely distort its decisions to alter future marginal benefits and marginal costs of the program and thus manipulate Congress's future decisions over quantities to procure. Congress must weigh the benefits and costs of delegation and then determine how much authority to delegate. Two examples of such decisions will now be described.",'314,'92.04101563
'33,'Text 216,"'The first example concerns the trade-off between quality and quantity. Many institutional analyses of defense procurement have argued that the same expenditures would produce a more effective defense if larger numbers of less elaborate and less technically sophisticated weapons were purchased [Gansler (1980, pp. 15-21), Peck and Scherer (1962, ch. 13), Stubbing (1986, ch. 8)]. This outcome can also be seen as the result of an agency problem between Congress and the military. Rogerson (1990) describes a simple framework where the military chooses the quality of weapons, and then Congress chooses quantity. In this model, the military's goal is to maximize the benefits of military preparedness, while Congress's goal is to maximize the benefits of military preparedness minus the costs. The major result is that when quality and quantity are not good substitutes, that the military will purposely choose a quality higher than the efficient level. The intuition behind this result is that the military can increase military preparedness by purposely increasing quality above the efficient level because this induces a relatively small decrease in Congress's quantity choice.",'315,'91.89453125
'33,'Text 217,"'An interesting feature of this model is that the military is assumed to be as good an agent as one could realistically hope for. The military agrees with Congress's definition of military preparedness and makes a good-faith effort to maximize this. If given a fixed budget, the military in this model would always choose quality and quantity to maximize military preparedness. The distortion arises because the military is able to manipulate Congress into increasing the budget by increasing quality. In this model, budget-maximizing behavior on the part of defense bureaucrats is caused by the relatively idealistic goal of maximizing the bureau's production of social benefits.",'316,'90.47851563
